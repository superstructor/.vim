.vim
=====

This is my .vimrc and associated plugins, syntax files and colorschemes that I use. Here more for my personal convenience than anything else.

If your interested feel free use it without restriction as long as you comply with the licenses of the included dependencies. You will probably want to make modifications to suit your editing preferences and requirements.

Setup
------

Clone into ~/.vim

    cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/superstructor/.vim

Link ~/.vimrc to ~/.vim/vimrc

    cd ~ && ln -sv ~/.vim/vimrc .vimrc
